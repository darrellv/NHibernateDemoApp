# NHibernateDemoApp

This application demonstrates how to use NHibernate to do Object Relation Mapping.

It shows how to do the following:
  set up configuration in the code,
  set up hbm xml file which maps object properties to database column names,
  create a session (think of a database connection),
  set up caching,
  set up batch processing,
  and...
  Create, Read, Update, and Delete records
